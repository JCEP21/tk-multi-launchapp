        description: "The name of the Nuke engine to start. When this app runs, it will first

                     Shot or Task in Shotgun from which the action was initiated. Once the
                     environment has been established (one of the files in the env folder in
                     the Tank configuration), an engine will be started. This parameter
                     specifies which engine to start. Typically this should be set to tk-nuke
                     for the standard Nuke engine."
